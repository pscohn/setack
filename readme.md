stack-oriented language to operate on sets
```

* Implement procedures: map from variable to setexp, need a setexp literal
  symbol (symbol*) [body] proc
  x (x, y) [x y +]
  [] = set expression literal
* Update readme to include key features and a more detailed description of the language. Interpreted dynamically-typed stack-oriented language, etc.
